We collected $2,600 during our Indiegogo campaign and we'll also get $18,000 from a startup accelerator soon.
We're counting this amount towards our goals. That means we've secured the future of VirtKick,
we're reaching the first two stretch goals, and our team can work full-time - yay!

## What is VirtKick?

VirtKick is your self-hosted VPS panel, similar to DigitalOcean. It's open source and code is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/virtkick/virtkick). Wanna play with the alpha on your Linux desktop?
[Give it a whirl](https://github.com/virtkick/virtkick-starter#virtkick-take-cloud-back).


## What is Commercial Bundle?

Commercial Bundle is a complete set features usable by VPS hosting providers.

If you'd like to become a provider, VirtKick will let you do that.
You won't need any external billing software - VirtKick will be self-contained.
However, we'll support WHMCS and Blesta in future but they'll be fully optional.
